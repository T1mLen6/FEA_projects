 This SOLVE command is only used to generate the matrices needed to      
 perform the linear perturbation analysis.  The linear perturbation      
 analysis corresponds to time = 1 (load step = 1, substep = 1).  No      
 results are being written.

 The prior(base) analysis is LINEAR, use the total load prescribed in    
 the linear perturbation process to calculate the critical               
 eigen-buckling loads.

 The Sparse Matrix Solver is currently running in the in-core memory     
 mode.  This memory mode uses the most amount of memory in order to      
 avoid using the hard drive as much as possible, which most often        
 results in the fastest solution time.  This mode is recommended if      
 enough physical memory is present to accommodate all of the solver      
 data.

 Reading results into the database (SET command) will update the current 
 displacement and force boundary conditions in the database with the     
 values from the results file for that load set.  Note that any          
 subsequent solutions will use these values unless action is taken to    
 either SAVE the current values or not overwrite them (/EXIT,NOSAVE).

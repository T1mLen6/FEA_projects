 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.203   TIME= 17:25:47
 Element shape checking is currently inactive.  Issue SHPP,ON or         
 SHPP,WARN to reactivate, if desired.                                    

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.828   TIME= 17:25:47
 All selected contact pairs are initially open.  Rigid body motion can   
 occur.  You may use auto CNOF/ICONT by setting KEYOPT(5) to close       
 small gaps.                                                             

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =      13.344   TIME= 17:25:50
 There is at least 1 small equation solver pivot term (e.g., at the UZ   
 degree of freedom of node 3698) which may indicate a numerically        
 unstable model.  Please check your results carefully.                   

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =      14.562   TIME= 17:25:50
 A reference force value times the tolerance is used by the              
 Newton-Raphson method for checking convergence.  The calculated         
 reference FORCE CONVERGENCE VALUE = 7.031965848E-06 is less than a      
 threshold.  This threshold is internally calculated.  You can           
 overwrite it by specifying MINREF on the CNVTOL command.  Check         
 results carefully.
